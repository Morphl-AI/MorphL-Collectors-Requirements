## MorphL - Collectors (Tracking Settings)

These are the steps required for setting up client ID tracking in [Google Analytics](https://github.com/Morphl-Project/MorphL-Tracking-Settings/tree/master/google-analytics) & [Google Tag Manager](https://github.com/Morphl-Project/MorphL-Tracking-Settings/tree/master/google-tag-manager).

More analytics platform will be supported in the future.

If you're using a Single Page Application (based on Angular JS, React, Vue.js, etc.), please take a look at [these requirements](SPAS.md).
