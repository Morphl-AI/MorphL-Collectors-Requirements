## MorphL - Scroll Tracking for Google Tag Manager

To add automatic scroll tracking to every page on your site and send events to Google Analytics please use the library for observing scrolling behavior available at [https://github.com/lunametrics/scroll](https://github.com/lunametrics/scroll).

By default, it tracks user scroll depth at the 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% marks, but can be customized.

This library has been created by the folks at [LunaMetrics](http://www.lunametrics.com/), a digital marketing & Google Analytics consultancy. Written by [Dan Wilkerson](https://twitter.com/notdanwilkerson).
