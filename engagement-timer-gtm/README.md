## MorphL - Engagement Timer for Google Tag Manager

To add engagement time tracking to every page on your site and send events to Google Analytics please use the library for observing page engagement available at [https://github.com/lunametrics/engagement-timer](https://github.com/lunametrics/engagement-timer).

By default, this tracks events every 15 seconds up to a maximum of 30 minutes, and pauses when the page is not the active tab in the browser or when the user hasnâ€™t moved the mouse or pressed a key in the page in the last 65 seconds. (These values are configurable via variables.)

This library has been created by the folks at [LunaMetrics](http://www.lunametrics.com/), a digital marketing & Google Analytics consultancy. Written by [Dan Wilkerson](https://twitter.com/notdanwilkerson).
