## MorphL - Vimeo Video Tracking for Google Tag Manager

To automatically track interactions with embedded Vimeo videos on your site and send events to Google Analytics please use the library available at [https://github.com/lunametrics/vimeo-google-analytics](https://github.com/lunametrics/vimeo-google-analytics).

This recipe will fire events to Google Analytics when users Play, Pause, Watch to End, and view 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90% of the video.

This library has been created by the folks at [LunaMetrics](http://www.lunametrics.com/), a digital marketing & Google Analytics consultancy. Written by [Dan Wilkerson](https://twitter.com/notdanwilkerson).
